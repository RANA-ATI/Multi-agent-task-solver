--- Research-only final ---
Based on the search results, here are two recent key statistics:

"Pakistan has around 70,000 electric motorcycles, 5,200 electric cars and 450 electric buses" - Government report via news sources

"In 2023 the vehicle market totalled 81,587 total sales, down 63.7%" - Flash report, December 2023

Synthesis: Pakistan's EV adoption shows a mixed picture, with electric motorcycles leading the transition at 70,000 units. While the overall vehicle market experienced a significant decline in 2023, the presence of over 5,200 electric cars and 450 electric buses indicates growing EV penetration, though still at an early stage compared to global markets.

Please provide the year range and/or EV type you're interested in, and I'll search for and summarize those specific statistics.
